# Software Development Standards

## About
This repository houses the standards and guidelines for software development within RSK-BSL, aiming to ensure consistency across the business.. These standards are integral to RSK-BSL's software development policy and apply to all software development activities conducted on behalf of the RSK-BSL group, whether by employees, contractors, or third-party vendors.

All developers representing RSK-BSL are expected to adhere to these standards as part of their professional obligations.

Any departure from these standards must be formally managed through RSK-BSL's architectural governance procedures.

We maintain these standards on GitHub to ensure maximum visibility and accessibility for all developers, providing a familiar platform for reference. For assistance with readability, please consult the GitHub documentation on managing accessibility settings.

Implementing coding standards within RSK-BSL offers several benefits:
-  Promotes uniformity, making codebases more readable and maintainable.
-  Consistent standards facilitate collaboration among developers and reduce the risk of errors and vulnerabilities.
-  Support scalability and smooth transitions between team members, ultimately fostering a culture of excellence in software development.
